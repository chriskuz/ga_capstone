    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Aviation is one of the largest industries dominating our global market today. Commercial aviation has made it possible for people to connect with each other in ways that may have been unimaginable over a century ago. However, a lot of thought must be put into the FAA standards and routes that modern planes must make today to make such connections possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case example where a startup airliner, known as \"Kruze\", wants to establish itself as a top competitor against existing airliners today. A part of this startup process focuses on understanding the costs that will come into play when managing flights. Our job as data scientists today is to help Kruze determine the minimum threshold cost the airliner must charge their passengers on a ticket class basis in order to break even with a profit. To do this, we are going to use existing flight routes (velocity and altitude data), existing data on jet fuel pricing, and existing flight ticket prices (as a prediction) to help us create a supervised learning model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we will approach the project with the intention of expressing a minimum proof of concept. With such introduction, we will make some limitations to our study and decrease the potential for scope increase by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- conducting an idealized thermal jet propulsion cycle for feature engineering purposes (focusing on an open Brayton cycle in particular)\n",
    "- analyzing flight route data across the U.S. domestically; choosing up to 3 routes of varying sizes and suggesting their reverse flight paths as data inputs as well. \n",
    "    - **Houston, TX** to **Los Angeles, CA** (IAH - LAX)\n",
    "    - **New York City, NY** to **Miami, FL** (JFK - MIA)\n",
    "    - **Portland, WA** to **Chicago, IL** (PDX - ORD)\n",
    "- assuming air to be treated as an ideal gas\n",
    "- assuming operating engine conditions to be steady state\n",
    "- assuming kinetic energy and potential energy to be negligible in our system, except at inlet and exit conditioins of jet engine itself\n",
    "- assuming atmospheric temperature, pressure, and air density to be an averaged value between 0 and 15,000 meters altitude\n",
    "- assuming data incorporating head or tail wind effects to be negligible\n",
    "- assuming passenger weight to be negligible\n",
    "- assuming external costs from the study (including food/maintenance/crew salary) to be negligible\n",
    "- using price data from future flights as opposed to previous flights as previous flight pricing is not readily available\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All current assumptions labeled are set to allow us to achieve (or attempt to achieve) our goal within a certain time frame, as Kruze is requiring an answer from us quickly! With this in mind, we will consider discussing how such assumptions can contribute to any error throughout our study, as well as remind ourselves that integrating negated features for future work may actually be very beneficial to us in achieveing a stronger prediction. Conducting an idealized thermal engine analysis will help us understand the average power output of a given plane's engines throughout different phases of its flight. Routes chosen throughout a variety of times and seasons will also help us determine how such elements play a role in pricing. Finally, some plane specifications (including aircraft type, number of seats it supports, as well as type/number of engines) will allow us to consider any extra technical factors for ticket pricing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we are working with what is considerred to be a continuous variable, we will analyze common price trends utilizing a supervised regression model, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVR, AdaBoosting Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, KNNRegression, and Naive Bayes Regression. We will ultimately be using the Mean Absolute Error against our predictions to help us gauge how well our selected model predicts the price and discuss what issues may be observed from the limitations of this study.\n",
